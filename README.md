# LED lamp
This repository contains the reverse engineered code for the led [lamp app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ledlamp&pcampaignid=web_share) found on the playstore.
I wanted to add some features and realised it wasnt open source thus i forced it opensource.
there is work to be done until it gets into a mouldable shape. If you'd like you contribute open a pr.
